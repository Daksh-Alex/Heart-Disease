## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is key to improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. Various models from `scikit-learn` are used to identify patterns in the data, while `matplotlib` is employed to visualize the results.

## Project Overview

The project's main objectives are:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing heart disease.
- Building and evaluating predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- Visualizing results and patterns using `matplotlib`.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains patient information, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. It includes a label indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The data was sourced from [UCI Heart Disease Dataset]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?spm=5176.100239.blogco
nt54260.8.TRNGoO]).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-analysis.git
    ```
2. Change directory to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd heart-disease-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Note:** The `requirements.txt` file contains `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and other necessary dependencies.

## Usage

1. Run the data analysis script:
    ```bash
    python heart_disease_analysis.py
    ```
2. The script will perform exploratory data analysis, train machine learning models, and display relevant visualizations.

3. The results, including model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.), will be printed to the console.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions and relationships in the dataset using histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.
- **Model Building:** Train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to evaluate model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` to create plots that help interpret the data and model results.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of `X%` (modify as per your project's results). Key features contributing to the model's predictions include cholesterol levels, age, blood pressure, etc. Visualizations generated include:
- Correlation heatmap to identify important features.
- ROC curve to evaluate model performance.
- Feature importance plot for models like Random Forest.

## Future Work

- Implement additional machine learning models for comparison.
- Incorporate cross-validation to optimize model hyperparameters.
- Use advanced techniques such as neural networks for improved predictions.
- Add more visualizations for better insights into the dataset.
